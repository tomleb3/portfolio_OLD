            <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Tom. Nice to meet you.</h3>
            <p>Since beginning my journey to becoming a Full-Stack Developer,<br />
                I've worked countless hours to perfect my code, my designs, and everything related.<br />
                I enjoy coding, whilst keeping the code as clean, simple and reusable as possible.</p>
